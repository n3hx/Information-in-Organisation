    <description>During the late years of the 18th century, the spirit of Enlightenment thinking and revolution were in the air. The world was changing, moving away from ingrained beliefs about religion, reason, society, and the rights of the individual and turning more toward the laws of nature as interpreted by the scientific method. Nowhere was the influence of this radical new way of thinking more apparent than in France, and the upheaval this caused would come to bloody fruition in the form of revolution.</description>

    <title>Atomic Habits: the life-changing million-copy</title>
    <price> 610 </price>
    <author>James Clear</author>
    <description>Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.

        People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.
        
        He calls them atomic habits.
        
        In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.
        
        These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.

    <title>When You're Ready, This Is How You Heal: Let Go and Find Yourself</title>
    <price> 930 </price>
    <author>Brianna West</author>
    <description>Painful events in our lives can throw us off course permanently. In her new book, Brianna Wiest shows how we can heal ourselves. Healing means accepting the pain and really looking. Healing is embarking on a journey, because whether physical or spiritual, it is neither linear nor seamless. Healing means vulnerability. Healing means moving on, with a wounded but open heart. Healing happens when we learn to let go and find the courage to see our past life for what it was so that we can see our present life for what it is: full of hope and potential. This book is balm for every soul on the journey of its own becoming.</description>

    <title>The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage Into Self-Mastery</title>
    <price> 500 </price>
    <author>Brianna Wiest</author>
    <description>It's a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing it, for good. Coexisting but contradictory needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they seem totally futile. But by extracting crucial information from our most damaging habits, developing emotional intelligence by better understanding our brain and body, releasing past experiences at the cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future future, we can step out of our own way and step into our potential. For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the great challenges we face, especially those that seem impossible to overcome. To climb our mountains, we need to do the deep inner work of digging into trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we present ourselves for the climb. In the end, it is not the mountain that we master, but ourselves.</description>

    <title>Things We Don't Talk about</title>
    <price> 800 </price>
    <author> Pandora Owl</author>
    <description>"Things We Don't Talk About" is a short collection of thoughts, quotes and poetry highlighting some hardships of living with depression and mental illness and the effects it has on relationships with yourself and loved ones. It's a personal lens into the darkest places your mind can take you and the struggle of battling your own mind. It's a peak of what's underneath the surface that most people battle in silence, something you may or may not relate to. If you're reading this, it's not too late and you're not alone. In addition, I just wanted to say thank you for allowing me to share a part of me, whether it was specifically of value to you. I hope to make at least one person in this world to feel less alone. Communication and or expressing our feelings, it's one of the hardest things to do. Often we get discouraged to even try to express ourselves due to the fear of not being understood and or not doing it the "right" way. We are all human and the best thing we can do is to continue trying. Please keep an open mind and always lead with love.</description>

    <title>Louder than Words: Harness the Power of Your Authentic Voice</title>
    <price> 510 </price>
    <author>Todd Henry</author>
    <description>The next step in personal effectiveness, by the acclaimed author of The Accidental Creative and Die Empty.

      There has never been a better time to build an audience around your idea or product. But with so many people and companies clamoring for attention, it’s also more challenging than ever to do work that deeply resonates with the marketplace and creates true and lasting impact.
      According to Todd Henry, the key to standing apart from the noise is to find your unique voice. Those who identify and develop their voices will gain more attention and wield more influence. But first they have to identify what they truly stand for, develop a compelling vision, and become masters of expressing their ideas in whatever media they choose. Henry offers strategies, exercises, and true stories that illustrate the five attributes of resonant work: Authenticity: Uncover the narratives that are at the core of your personal and professional identity.Uniqueness: Identify what makes your work distinct from that of others, and learn to creatively package and present your message.Consonance: Cultivate internal consistency and harmony in your work. Empathy: Listen to your audience’s aspirations and struggles to make your message more compelling.Timing: Learn how to coordinate your work with ideas that already have cultural momentum.
      Making your work speak is a life-long process of trial, error, and realignment. Henry’s book will help readers build a body of work that resonates deeply and achieves lasting impact.

    <title>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD</title>
    <price>  750 </price>
    <author>Harper Lee</author>
    <description> A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel - a black man falsely charged with the rape of a white girl. Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.
      To Kill a Mockingbird is a coming-of-age story, an anti-racist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition.

    <author> Lucinda Riley, Harry Whittaker</author>
    <description>Spanning a lifetime of love and loss, crossing borders and oceans, Atlas: The Story of Pa Salt, co-authored by her son Harry Whittaker, draws Lucinda Riley's Seven Sisters series to its stunning, unforgettable conclusion.
      1928, Paris
      A boy is found, moments from death, and taken in by a kindly family. Gentle, precocious, talented, he flourishes in his new home, and the family show him a life he hadn't dreamed possible. But he refuses to speak a word about who he really is.
      As he grows into a young man, falling in love and taking classes at the prestigious Conservatoire de Paris, he can almost forget the terrors of his past, or the promise he has vowed to keep. But across Europe an evil is rising, and no-one's safety is certain. In his heart, he knows the time will come where he must flee once more.
      2008, the Aegean
      The seven sisters are gathered together for the first time, on board the Titan to say a final goodbye to the enigmatic father they loved so dearly.
      To the surprise of everyone, it is the missing sister who Pa Salt has chosen to entrust with the clue to their pasts. But for every truth revealed, another question emerges. The sisters must confront the idea that their adored father was someone they barely knew. And even more shockingly: that these long-buried secrets may still have consequences for them today.

    <author>Delia Owens</author>
    <description>For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. Goal Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life - until the unthinkable happens.
    Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Celeste Ng, Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.
